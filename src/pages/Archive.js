            As we move into a digital world, I constantly see historical practices slip into the cracks and disappear. I vividly remember having a several hour argument with a friend 
            who was swearing up and down the the reason I couldn't find guides on how to put my hair up with ribbon was because it was impossible. Just because it wasn't easily 
            findable on the first page of Google, he assumed that it wasn't real and condescended me on a topic on which he had no expertise. I had to teach myself how to put my hair 
            up with a silk ribbon and nothing else, and after I had it down I was so proud of myself for sticking to what I knew about history. I then imagined what it would have been 
            like for another person, one who hadn't read historical fiction or seen many paintings of people with their hair up in ribbons. Would they have just given up and assumed...
             I don't know what? That since there's no Google tutorial easily within reach, then it never existed?

            In my own little Internet nest I call home, I want to devote this space to all the little things I learned from history, little practices and hobbies and traditions. 
            Practices I had no idea even existed until that nice older lady at Joanns told me, or that sweet grandma in the checkout line. How to crochet lace by hand, how to 
            handcraft shoes from leather. How to made a padded bra without synthetic padding (turns out, feathers!). I want there to be just a few more resources out there for 
            people like me who know it's possible and just can't find someone who made a video about it.

            I source these the very best I can, but they are my own self research and are a product of my own bias. If you see a mistake, please message me in my contact page with 
            your source so I can add it. If your modification is a subjective opinion, please keep it to yourself. I get enough of those volunteered to me by men who don't know 
            that you can put your hair up with a ribbon.

        <h2>Short, Practical Consumerism Tidbits</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li><b>You can buy shampoo and conditioner in bar form</b> - I got mine off <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/NaturisticBath">Etsy</a>, 
            but you can buy it at your local <a href="https://www.sprouts.com/healthy-living/shampoo-bars/">Sprouts.</a></li> After trying a dozen plus bar shampoos this Etsy seller is 
            the only one that worked for me, so you may have to try a few before you find something that's compatible with your hair type.
        </ul>

            <li><b>Aluminum powder in deoderant is not bad for you</b> - At least, not according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/antiperspirants-and-breast-cancer-risk.html">Cancer Society of America</a>. I could not find any links to health dangers 
            when researching this, just advertisements claiming that their product doesn't contain aluminum and articles saying it's not dangerous. You are much more likely to be allergic to the ton of alternative powders like arrowroot used in 
            aluminum free deorderants than you are to be allergic to aluminum, or allergic to all the oils added to help mask the fact that aluminum alternatives do not do as good of a job.</li>
